# 04 — CLI

Implemented with Typer. Entry point: `tracelabel` (also runnable as `uvx tracelabel …` and
`python -m tracelabel`). Export and suggest never require a running server (invariant #10).

## 1. Command surface

```
tracelabel serve   [TARGET] [--task NAME] [--level turn|trace] [--annotator NAME]
                   [--shuffle/--no-shuffle] [--db PATH] [--port N] [--no-browser] [--yes] [--all]
tracelabel import  TARGET [--from auto|ctf|adk|datadog|documents] [--db PATH]
                   [--on-conflict fail|skip] [--skip-invalid] [--as-documents]
tracelabel export  [--task NAME] [--db PATH] [--format jsonl|csv] [--joined]
                   [--out PATH] [--status labeled|skipped|all]
tracelabel tasks   list [--db PATH]
tracelabel suggest [TARGET] [--task NAME] [--db PATH] [--limit N] [--overwrite] [--concurrency N]
tracelabel demo    [--port N] [--no-browser]
```

`TARGET` is a `.yaml`/`.yml` config, a data file (`.jsonl`/`.json`), **or a directory** of
document files (`.md`/`.markdown`/`.txt`/`.text`/`.html`/`.htm` — the folder-of-docs quick
start, 07 §4). If it's a data file or directory, an implicit empty config is assumed (all
defaults). The project directory (where `.tracelabel/` lives) is TARGET itself for a
directory, otherwise the directory containing TARGET.

A bare single document file (e.g. `notes.md`) is **not** a supported target — it has no real
use case as a one-trace project. It's rejected with a message pointing at a JSONL of documents
or a directory of files.

For `serve` and `suggest`, `TARGET` may be omitted: the CLI then looks for `./config.yaml`
in the current directory and uses it if present, otherwise exits with the "No data file
given" error (§9, exit 1).

## 2. `serve` (the main verb)

```python
def serve(target, **cli_flags):
    raw   = load_yaml(target) if is_yaml(target) else RawConfig(data=target)
    cfg   = resolve(raw, cli_flags)                    # 03 §4
    conn  = open_db(cfg)                               # migrations run here (02 §3)
    port  = pick_port(cli_flags.port or 8377)          # try requested, then next 10; print choice
    acquire_lock(project_dir, port)                    # 02 §1

    summary = import_file(conn, cfg.data_path, source="jsonl", on_conflict="fail")  # idempotent
    open_task(conn, cfg, assume_yes=cli_flags.yes)     # drift guard lives here (02 §5)

    ids   = None if cli_flags.all else summary.trace_ids
    queue = build_queue(conn, cfg, ids)                 # §3 — scoped to the served file by default
    app   = build_fastapi(conn, cfg, queue)              # 05
    if not cli_flags.no_browser: open_browser(f"http://127.0.0.1:{port}")
    scope = f"{len(queue)} traces (whole db)" if cli_flags.all else f"{len(queue)} traces from {cfg.data_path.name}"
    print(f"tracelabel · task '{cfg.name}' ({cfg.level}-level) · {scope} · http://127.0.0.1:{port}")
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=port)      # 127.0.0.1 ONLY — invariant #6
```

One `serve` process = one task. Labeling a second dimension is a second invocation with a
different `--task`.

**File-as-lens (default, opt-out via `--all`):** the queue and progress bar are scoped to the
traces contained in `cfg.data_path` — the ids the just-completed idempotent import reports
back (`summary.trace_ids`, file order). The db is a shared pool: traces persist across files,
annotations key on `(task, target_id, annotator)` and accumulate regardless of which file is
being served. `export` and `tasks list` stay db-wide (lifetime views over the whole pool);
only the `serve`/`suggest` queue is scoped. `serve <file> --all` still imports `<file>`
(idempotent, as always) but then builds the queue from the whole db (`ids=None`, §3) — the
old, pre-scoping behavior, for the rare "label everything" case.

## 3. Queue ordering (shuffle)

```python
def build_queue(conn, cfg, trace_ids: list[str] | None) -> list[str]:  # ordered trace ids
    if trace_ids is None:
        ids = [r[0] for r in conn.execute("SELECT id FROM traces ORDER BY imported_at, id")]
    else:
        ids = list(trace_ids)                          # scoped: file order, as reported by import
    seed = get_task_seed(conn, cfg.name)              # stored at task creation; stable on resume
    if seed is not None:
        random.Random(seed).shuffle(ids)
    return ids
```

Turn order within a trace is always `idx` — only trace order shuffles. When scoped, file order
(the order ids were reported by the import) replaces `imported_at, id` as the base sequential
order before shuffling.

## 4. `import`

Idempotent by design (02 §4); safe to re-run after appending lines to the JSONL, or after
re-serving a directory. `--from auto` (default) runs format detection (07 §2), which includes
the `documents` adapter. `--as-documents` is an alias for `--from documents` on JSONL/JSON
input — force every line to be interpreted as a document even if it would otherwise sniff as
something else. A directory target always imports as documents, one per file (07 §4); `--from`
may not be combined with a directory (each file's extension already determines its content
type). Prints a summary, including any adapter notes (skipped files, interpreted keys):

```
imported traces.jsonl: 412 inserted, 88 skipped (duplicate), 0 conflicts, 2 invalid lines skipped
imported docs: 14 inserted, 0 skipped (duplicate), 0 conflicts, 0 invalid lines skipped
  skipped 3 unsupported files
```

## 5. `export`

Reads the db directly. Default `--out`: `<task>-annotations.<format>` in the CWD; `-` = stdout.

**Long format (default), one row per annotation.** Columns:

```
task, trace_id, target_type, target_id, turn_index (NULL for trace-level),
annotator, status, prefill_model, schema_hash, created_at, updated_at,
value.<field_name> ...            # one column per field in the task's resolved schema
```

- JSONL: `values` nested as an object; CSV: flattened `value.verdict`, `value.reasoning`, …
- Multi-select in CSV: JSON-array string (`'["hallucination","formatting"]'`) — unambiguous
  to `json.loads` in pandas.
- Skipped rows appear with empty values unless `--status labeled`.

**`--joined`**: adds `role`, `content`, `content_type`, `trace_metadata`, `source` (turn-level);
at trace-level it adds `trace_metadata` plus either full serialized `messages` (conversation
trace) or `content` + `content_type` (document trace) — whichever applies. Either way a pandas
user never joins back to the source. `trace_metadata` is the vector for dataset/batch
provenance (10 §5) — it's user-supplied at import time, not synthesized by tracelabel;
`source` is the import adapter name, not a dataset tag — don't rely on it to identify which
file a trace came from.

```python
def export(conn, task, fmt, joined, out, status):
    schema = load_task_schema(conn, task)
    rows = conn.execute(BASE_SQL + (JOIN_TURNS_SQL if joined else ""), ...)
    write(out, flatten(rows, schema.field_names, fmt))
```

## 6. `tasks list`

```
TASK        LEVEL  PROGRESS        SCHEMA    UPDATED
empathy     turn   137/482 turns   a3f2c9…   2026-07-11 18:04
escalation  trace  200/200 traces  77bd01…   2026-07-09 10:22
```

## 7. `suggest`

Batch pre-annotation (08). Requires the `[ai]` extra; if litellm is missing:
`AI assist needs the optional extra: pip install 'tracelabel[ai]'`. Like `serve`, `suggest
TARGET` runs the same idempotent import first, then scopes its targets to
`summary.trace_ids` — `tracelabel suggest week-28.jsonl --task empathy` only suggests over
week 28, not the whole pool. There's no `--all` for `suggest`; pass a file that covers the
scope you want (or `--limit` a large number against the config's data file).

## 8. `demo`

Copies bundled sample traces (packaged data: ~25 realistic agent traces incl. tool calls, a
JSON doc, an HTML doc) into a temp project and runs `serve` with the zero-config default.
This is the README GIF and the entire 15-second pitch: `uvx tracelabel demo`, browser opens,
`j` `1` `Enter` works immediately. `--no-browser` suppresses the browser auto-open (for
tmux/remote users and the CI e2e smoke, which drives the server directly).

## 9. Exit codes & conventions

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | user/config error (bad YAML, invalid CTF, drift declined) |
| 2 | environment error (port range exhausted, locked project, db newer than app) |
| 130 | interrupted (Ctrl-C) — must still release the lock |

All prompts (`confirm(...)`) must be bypassable with `--yes` for scripting. Errors go to
stderr; data (e.g. `export --out -`) to stdout.
